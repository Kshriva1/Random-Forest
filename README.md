# Random-Forest

For this project we will be exploring publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors).We will try to create a model that will help predict this.

[Lending club](LendingClub.com) had a very interesting year in 2016, so let's check out some of their data and keep the context in mind. This data is from before they even went public.
